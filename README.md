# ⚖️ Disclaimer

This repo is personal work. The puzzle inputs are often unique to each user, so strictly copying the answers won't work for you. However, feel free to read the code for inspiration!

Note on Inputs: The creator of Advent of Code asks that we generally do not publish our puzzle inputs. If you clone this repo, you will need to download your own inputs from the website and save them as input.txt in the respective day's folder.
